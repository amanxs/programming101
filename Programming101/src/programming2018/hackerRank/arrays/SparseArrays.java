There are N strings. Each stringâ€™s length is no more than 20 characters.
There are also Q queries. For each query, you are given a string, and you need to find out how many times this string occurred previously.

Input Format

The first line contains N, the number of strings.
The next N lines each contain a string.
The N+2nd line contains Q, the number of queries.
The following Q lines each contain a query string.
