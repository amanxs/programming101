 * In many applications, it makes sense to allow clients to refer to items that are already on the priority queue.
 * One easy way to do so is to associate a unique integer index with each item.
 * Moreover, it is often the case that clients have a universe of items of a known size N
 * and perhaps are using (parallel) arrays to store information about the items,
 * so other unrelated client code might already be using an integer index to refer to items
