/**
 * our initial design goal is to decouple our implementations from the graph representation.
 * To do so, we develop, for each given task, a task-specific class so that clients can create objects to perform the task.
 * Generally, the constructor does some preprocessing to build data structures so as to efficiently respond to client queries.
 * A typical client program builds a graph, passes that graph to an algorithm implementation class (as argument to a constructor),
 * and then calls client query methods to learn various properties of the graph.
